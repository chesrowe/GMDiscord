# **GMDiscord**
Welcome to the **GMDiscord** docs! This library provides Discord API integration for GameMaker, allowing you to create interactive and engaging experiences for your Discord community directly in GML.

I've tried to follow the [official docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs) very closely. 

One thing to note is that the API refers to Discord servers as *Guilds*. Any time you see a reference to a guild, that means server. 

## **Main Features**

### **discordBot()**
The `discordBot()` constructor function is the core of the GMDiscord library. It provides the interface between your GameMaker project and the Discord API. For more details on how to use this function, visit the [discordBot()](discordBot().md) page.

### **Commands**
Commands are a crucial part of any Disscord bot. They allow users to interact with your bot and trigger specific actions. You can find more information about how to implement and use commands in GMDiscord on the [Commands](Commands) page.

### **Handling Gateway Events**
Gateway events are how Discord communicates real-time updates to your bot. Understanding how to handle these events is key to creating a responsive and interactive bot. Learn more about handling gateway events on the [Handling gateway events](Handling-gateway-events) page.

### **Message Components**
Message components are a way to add interactive elements to your bot's messages. They can be used to create more engaging and dynamic interactions with your users. Find out more about message components on the [Message components](Message-components) page.

## **Contribute**
GMDiscord is an open-source project, and contributions are always welcome!
